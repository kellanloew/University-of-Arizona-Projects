# University-of-Arizona-Projects
These are the two biggest projects I created as part of my course on C at the University of Arizona.
The Game of 31 Project was a collaboration project between me and another classmate. In this game, the player competes against the dealer (the computer) in the poker game 31.

The IP Address project would let the user input an IP address, and then check a list of addresses stored in a file to see if the given one belonged to a the same network as any of the others.
These were the steps:
- Ask the user to enter an IP address in the IP format x:y:z:w
- Ask the user to enter the length of the network part of the IP address.
- Ask the user to enter an os, or enter \?" for all operating systems.
- Print all IP addresses that belong to the same network and are assigned to hosts running the same operating
system.
